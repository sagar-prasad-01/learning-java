react::
===========================================
Components:
it is a function which returns jsx code(javascript xml);


React Fragments:(<>//</>)
it is a wrapper which is used to wrap all the html elemetns in a single unit without adding extra nodes to the DOM.


js in html:
we can use it by the help of  {},
we write js code in the curly bracet.

condition:
(1)a>b?a:b


<p>{age>=18 && "you can vote"||"you cannot vote"}</p>
<p>{age>=18 ?"you can vote":"you cannot vote"}</p>
<button>{age>=18?"watch now":"not available"}</button>


note==In js every thing is object but in react every thing is component.
